    <h1>Most Boring Cheesecake</h1>
    <img src="../images/cheesecake.jpeg" alt="the saddest looking cheesecake" width="300">
    <h2>Yeah, it's just a boring cheesecake</h2>
    <p>I won't lie to you, it's just a flat flavorless cheesecake.</p>
    <h2>Things you'll probably need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 half of a cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>5 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I completely messed up the ingredient list...whatever, I don't care.</p>
    <h2>Directions that don't really matter because you're still going to mess it up</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Uno
            <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) or don't I don't care.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Deux
            <p>
                Mix around half of the ingredients.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Three
            <p>Mix the other half and just wing it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>4
            <p>Just put it in the oven until it looks like you can eat it without getting sick.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
